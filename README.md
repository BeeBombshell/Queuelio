# Queuelio


## The problem it solves :
During these tough times when humanity is struggling to survive, **it is essential to maintain social distancing and proper hygiene.** As a big crowd now is approaching the **vaccination centres**, it is obvious that there will be overcrowding.

This project implements virtual queues which will ensure social distancing and allow people to stand separate instead of crowding near the counter or the reception site which is a evolving necessity in covid settings!

**“ With Queuelio, you can just scan the OR code, enter the virtual world of queues and wait for your turn to arrive. Timely notifications will keep the user updated about his position in the Queue.”**

## Key-Features
- **Just scan the OR code!**
- **Enter the virtual world of queues and wait for your turn to arrive.** 
- **Timely notifications/sound alerts will keep the user updated about his position/Time Left in the Queue.**
- **Automated Check-in Authentication System for Following the Queue.**
- Reduces Crowding to Great Extent.
- Efficient Operation with Minimum Cost/No additional hardware Required
- Completely Contactless

## Challenges we ran into :
- Simultaneous Synchronisation of admin & queue members with instant Updates.
- Implementing Queue Data structure in MongoDB
- Building OTP API just from scratch using Flask.

```python
while(Queuelio.on):
        if covid_cases.slope<0:
                 print(True)
>>> True
```
