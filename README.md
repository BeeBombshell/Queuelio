## The problem it solves🎯
During these tough times when humanity is struggling to survive, **it is essential to maintain social distancing and proper hygiene**😷. As a big crowd now is approaching the vaccination centres, it is obvious that there will be overcrowding.

This project **implements virtual queues which will ensure social distancing** and allow people to stand separate instead of crowding near the counter or the reception site which is a evolving necessity in covid settings!

**“ With Queuelio, you can just scan the OR code 📱, enter the virtual world of queues and wait for your turn to arrive. Timely notifications 🔔 will keep the user updated about his position in the Queue.”**
